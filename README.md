# Connect-4-AI-with-Reinforcement-Learning-and-Temporal-Difference
This project develops an AI for Connect 4 using Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Difference (TD) methods. The AI learns optimal strategies through self-play by updating value functions based on the difference between predicted and actual outcomes. It combines game logic with machine learning techniques to improve decision-making.
