# Connect 4 AI with Reinforcement Learning and Temporal Difference

## Description
This project implements an AI for the Connect 4 game using Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Difference (TD) methods. The AI learns strategies by playing games against itself, refining its decision-making process through experience. Temporal Difference learning enables the AI to update its policy efficiently based on the difference between expected and actual rewards.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Employs TD learning to improve gameplay through experience.
- **Self-Play Training:** AI trains itself by simulating games and learning from outcomes.
- **Dynamic Decision-Making:** Adapts strategies during gameplay to optimize performance.
- **Efficient Evaluation:** Uses heuristic evaluation to make informed decisions during training and gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Numpy** for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing learning progress and gameplay results.

## How It Works
1. **Game Logic:** Implements the rules and mechanics of Connect 4.
2. **Reinforcement Learning:** 
   - Uses Temporal Difference learning to update value functions.
   - Calculates rewards and penalties based on game outcomes.
3. **Training:** The AI learns through self-play, refining its strategy over many games.
4. **Heuristic Evaluation:** Assesses board states to guide the AI's decision-making process.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/connect4-reinforcement-learning.git
   ```
